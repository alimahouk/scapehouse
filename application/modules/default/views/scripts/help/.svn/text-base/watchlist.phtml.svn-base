        <h3>Watchlist</h3>
        <p>Scapehouse is based on the concept of "watching". You "watch" people, and when these people post anything, you see it in the timeline on your home page.</p>
        <p>The watchlist helps you manage the people you watch. It also helps you see the other people on the site who are watching you.</p>
