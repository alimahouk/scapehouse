    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>For the past few years, we've noticed that the web lacks a proper platform on which someone can rapidly publish information to a wide audience. Scapehouse fulfills that need by allowing you to express yourself in the way that suits you. So no matter what medium you prefer, be it photos, audio*, video*, or just text (with some nice formatting options), you're sure to get excited about Scapehouse.</p>
    <p>The best thing about Scapehouse is it's open environment; it connects people to other people, and it connects people to information. <!--We also provide you with privacy tools to help ensure that the right information is only seen by the right people. --></p>
    <span class="footnote">* These are future features, we're working as fast as we can to bring them to you.</span>
    <h3>The Team</h3>
    <p>So far, it's just the two of us running Scapehouse.</p>
    <div class="teamProfilePics">
        <a href="/akay"><img class="profilePic" src="<?=$photo->display(1, "user", "small")?>" alt="Abdullah Khan" title="Abdullah Khan" width="75" height="75" /></a>
        <a href="/ali"><img class="profilePic" src="<?=$photo->display(3, "user", "small")?>" alt="Ali Razzouk" title="Ali Razzouk" width="75" height="75" /></a>

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>Special thanks to everyone in the open source community because, really, without great projects like Linux, Apache, and jQuery (it's quite a long list!<span class="emoticon smile" style="background: transparent url('/graphics/en/sprites/emoticon_strip.png') no-repeat -247px 0;display: inline-block;height: 19px;width: 19px;margin: 0 3px;vertical-align:bottom;"></span>), we don't think that Scapehouse would have become a reality.</p>
    <p>Some of the icons that you see on Scapehouse.com weren't made by us, and we admit it. We'd like to thank everyone who made beautiful collections of icons and other similar graphics, and put them online free-of-charge for everyone to use. They were really helpful and saved us lots of time and effort.</p>
