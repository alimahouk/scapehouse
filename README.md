# Scapehouse v1.0

A social networking website that combined elements from Facebook and Twitter.

This one is special because this was pretty much the very first proper coding project I embarked on with a friend from high school in 2009. This is where it all began.

P.S. I went by the surname "Razzouk" back then (story behind it but tl;dr it was an error at my school from when I joined and was never fixed until I graduated).
